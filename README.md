# Celebrity Face Dataset

**Celebrity Face Dataset** is an open-source web scraper designed to collect and generate datasets of celebrity faces from various categories. This tool automates the process of gathering names from publicly available sources and retrieving corresponding images from Google Image Search, followed by facial detection and cropping.

## How It Works

The scraper consists of two main components:

### 1. List Generator
This module generates a list of celebrities based on different categories. Currently, the following categories are supported:

| Category        | Source URL |
|---------------|------------|
| **Billionaires** | [Forbes Billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/) |
| **K-pop Artists** | [Billboard K-pop 100](https://www.billboard.com/lists/k-pop-artist-100-list-2024-ranked/) |
| **NBA Players** | [NBA Stats Leaders](https://www.nba.com/stats/leaders) |
| **US Artists** | [Billboard Artist 100](https://www.billboard.com/charts/artist-100/) |
| **US Politicians** | [YouGov US Politicians](https://today.yougov.com/ratings/politics/popularity/politicians/all) |

### 2. Image Generator
This module retrieves celebrity images using Google Image Search and processes them by:
- Scraping images from search results
- Evaluating and detecting the facial regions
- Cropping and saving the images

It uses the list generated by the **List Generator** to find relevant images.
